# Portfolio-Website
🌐 Portfolio Website

This is a responsive and interactive personal portfolio website created to present my profile, technical skills, and achievements in a visually engaging way. The website includes a sticky navigation header, an animated hero section with floating background elements, and smooth text reveal and scroll animations. An interactive image gallery with hover zoom and text overlay enhances user interaction. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project reflects my understanding of frontend fundamentals, UI/UX principles, and modern web design practices.
