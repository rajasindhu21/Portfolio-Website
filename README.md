✨ Floating Background Animation

This portfolio includes a floating background animation in the hero section, created using pure CSS. Soft circular shapes are positioned absolutely and animated with CSS keyframes to float smoothly across the screen. The animation adds subtle visual motion, enhances user engagement, and keeps the design modern without distracting from the main content.
